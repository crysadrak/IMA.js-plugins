Update HeadlineTypes to HeadlineType 

- **What?** Update HeadlineTypes to HeadlineType for better backward  compatibility (Is not breaking change, because i recently added those exports in previous changeset and i don't suppose anyone has had time to use them in the meantime.)
- **Why?** Unification of naming.
- **How?** Nothing.
